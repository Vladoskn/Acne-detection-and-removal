## Problem statement

Acne is one of the most spread skin diseases, that most of the population is affected at some point. However, having beautiful and healthy skin is popular and influenced by society nowadays, and for this reason many people use different apps to remove pimples from their photos manually to post them on social media. We decided to create an automatic pipeline to remove acne from photos to save valuable time spent on image processing.

## Datasets

In this task we tried two approaches and two datasets were used. The first one was a [custom dataset](https://github.com/Vladoskn/Acne-detection-and-removal/tree/main/final_dataset) created and markuped by us. It consists of 30 images and corresponding acne masks. The second one was [ACNE04](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/18yJcHXhzOv7H89t-Lda6phheAicLqMuZ) dataset. For each image there was a corresponding xml file containing bounding boxes for pimples.

## Description

The repository contains the [code](https://github.com/Vladoskn/Acne-detection-and-removal/blob/main/Acne_removal_final.ipynb) for several acne detection and removal approaches.
